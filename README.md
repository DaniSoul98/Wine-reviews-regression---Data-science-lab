# Wine reviews regression - Data Science Lab
Regression performed on Wine Reviews dataset approaching categorical features


In this work we introduce a possible approach to the Wine Reviews Dataset regression problem. The project aim is to forecast the quality of a given wine. The proposed approach consists in using different encoding ways for the dataset categorical features. The proposed regression models outperform the baseline defined for the problem and obtain overall satisfactory results
